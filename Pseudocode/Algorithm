Step 1-Firstly we need to fetch the details of the patients whom were tested for the COVID-19 from the clinic .
Step 2 -Import required package (pandas and numpy)
       import pandas as pd
       import numpy as np
      Pandas stands for panel data .
It is an open source python package which is used for data manipulation and data analysis.
It consists of single and multi dimensional data structures  for data manipulation
      Numpy stands for Numerical python.
It is also a open source python package consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.
Step 3- Next step is to Train and Test the data .
      Functions and methods used to perform training and testing(.random .permutations function) .iloc method
def data_split(data,ratio):
    shuffled = np.random.permutation(len(data))
    test_set_size = int(len(data) * ratio)
    test_indices = shuffled [:test_set_size
    train_indices = shuffled [test_set_size:]
    return data.iloc[train_indices], data.iloc[test_indices]
step 4- next we need to import  logistic regression from sklearn.linear_model 
      from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.).
      fit function
step 5 - Predict_proba function and fetch symptoms from user.
       # input features=[TEMP,Bodypain,Age,RunnyNose,DifficultyBreathe]
       inputFeatures=[98,0,21,0,-1]
       Probability_of_COVID_infection = clf.predict_proba([inputFeatures])[0][1]

Step 6 - Gives you probability and percentage of infection in a particular person.
